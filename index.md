## A.Hughes & O.J.B. - The Retreat

The backstory of this 4 track EP starts with A.Hughes and O.J.B. meeting serendipitously on a Zoom call about the company retreat. After the call, music was exchanged, a connection was made and the collaboration began. The results were a collection of songs meant to capture the fresh air and good vibes of a retreat and leave listeners feeling refreshed and motivated.
